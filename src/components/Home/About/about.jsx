						<p>I'm a third-year IT Undergrad student at the Institute of Engineering and Management in Kolkata. As a young and energetic enthusiast, I have invaluable hands-on experience managing multiple concurrent Application Development projects (Web and App), Creative Designs, and Software Development. I have the ability to make things creative by utilising skills learned while working on various projects. Aside from that, my major qualities include the ability to identify opportunities, overcome objections, work under pressure, build long-term relationships, and establish a profitable company.
